# FMP fractional max pooling
Implemented Fractional Max-Pooling, which is a modified Max-Pooling technique, in python. it works on the idea that if we can reduce the size of the image more gently in every pooling layer, we can have more pooling layers thus we can have more convolutional layers and can form deeper neural networks
